        <p className="mb-4 text-left">
          Register with your chosen provider. You'll typically need to provide identification to comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
          This verification process might take from a few minutes to several days.

        <p className="mb-4 text-left">
          Fund your transfer via bank transfer, debit card, or credit card. Be aware that some payment methods
          may incur additional fees or take longer to process.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-1 mt-8 text-left">5. Track and Confirm</h3>
        <p className="text-left">
          Most providers offer tracking features so you can monitor your transfer's progress.
          Once complete, both you and the recipient should receive confirmation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-left">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
      
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2 text-left">Ignoring the Total Cost</h3>
        <p className="text-left">
          Don't be fooled by "fee-free" transfers. Always calculate the total cost by considering both the upfront fee
          and the exchange rate offered compared to the mid-market rate.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2 text-left">Overlooking Transfer Speed</h3>
        <p className="text-left">
          If timing matters, check the estimated delivery time. The cheapest option isn't always helpful if the money
          arrives days later than needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div className="mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2 text-left">Neglecting Security</h3>
        <p className="text-left">
          Ensure your provider has proper security measures and regulatory compliance in place.
          Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true, as they often are.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 rounded-r-lg my-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-2 text-left">Important Note on Large Transfers</h3>
        <p className="text-left">
          For large amounts (typically over Â£10,000), consider using a specialist currency broker who can offer
          personalised service and potentially better rates. Some providers also offer forward contracts to lock in
          current exchange rates for future transfers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-left">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-left">
        International money transfers don't have to be complicated or expensive. By understanding the basics
        and comparing your options, you can save significantly on fees while ensuring your money arrives safely and promptly.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Remember that no single provider is best for all situations. Your optimal choice depends on factors like
        transfer amount, speed requirements, sending and receiving countries, and payment method preferences.
